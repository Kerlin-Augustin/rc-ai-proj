# AI Developer Setup
To launch the AI app,

Clone this repo

cd to this repos directory

Ensure your npm and node versions are up to date (currently node 20.x and npm 10.x)

nvm install

nvm use

npm ci

run npm start in the terminal window. (this runs a local server)

## Daily steps
Go to the main branch and pull all new changes that may have happened since you last coded.

Switch off of the main branch to your own branch

If you are creating a new branch from the new pulled changes you can start coding. If you are cd'ing back to a previous branch you were working on, do git merge main from that branch you want to work on.

# Warning
DO NOT PUSH CODE TO MAIN BRANCH!!!

### React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
